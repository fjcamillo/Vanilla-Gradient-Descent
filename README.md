Vanilla Gradient Descent Vectorized!

This project stands as a tutorial on how to vectorize functions. Vectorizing is a way were we remove the procedural way of doing calculations via loop, and taking advantage of matrix multiplication to do this.

Note:
Still learning to create a proper function and class for machine learning, will continuously reiterate this projects to make it up to date with the my knowledge
